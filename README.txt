This is an application aimed at facilitating the process of giving old, unnecessary things to people who may need them.
We easily indicate the institution / foundation to which we want to transfer a certain amount of items, e.g.
clothes, old household appliances, etc., and then order a courier who will collect and deliver
the items to the addressee on the date indicated by us.
The application was created as part of the PortfolioLab classes.
